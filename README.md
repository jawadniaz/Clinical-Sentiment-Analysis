# Depression Analysis Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning analysis system to study depression and stress factors using various demographic and behavioral indicators. The system employs multiple classification algorithms to predict stress levels and analyze the relationships between different variables that may contribute to depression and stress.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multiple machine learning models implementation:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Statistical analysis using ANOVA and Chi-Square tests
- Advanced visualization of results
- Feature importance analysis
- Model performance comparison

## Prerequisites
The following Python libraries are required:
```python
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
scipy
joblib
```

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset ("depression.csv") containing the following key features:
- Gender
- Age
- Occupation
- Days spent indoors
- Growing stress levels
- Mood swings
- Other related parameters

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Handles missing values using forward fill method
- Encodes categorical variables using LabelEncoder
- Implements feature engineering
- Performs data balancing using resampling techniques
- Normalizes numerical features using StandardScaler

### Model Training
The project implements three main models:

1. Random Forest Classifier
   - Includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
   - Features importance analysis
   - Cross-validation evaluation

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Linear kernel implementation
   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Missing value handling

3. Multinomial Logistic Regression
   - Multi-class classification
   - Feature coefficient analysis
   - Cross-validation assessment

### Statistical Analysis
- ANOVA tests for:
  - Age groups
  - Gender
  - Occupation
- Chi-Square test for categorical variable relationships
- Correlation analysis between different features

### Visualizations
The project includes various visualization techniques:
- Correlation matrices
- Feature importance plots
- Distribution plots
- Box plots for demographic analysis
- Confusion matrices
- Model performance comparisons
- Stress level analysis across different demographics

## Usage
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed
2. Place your dataset file ("depression.csv") in the project directory
3. Run the main script to perform the complete analysis
4. Models are automatically saved and can be loaded for future predictions

## Model Evaluation
The system evaluates models using multiple metrics:
- Accuracy scores
- Classification reports
- Confusion matrices
- Cross-validation scores
- Feature importance rankings

## Results
The project provides:
- Comprehensive analysis of depression and stress factors
- Comparative performance of different machine learning models
- Statistical significance of various demographic factors
- Visualizations of key findings and relationships

## Future Improvements
- Implementation of deep learning models
- Addition of more advanced feature engineering techniques
- Integration of external datasets for broader analysis
- Development of a web interface for real-time predictions
- Implementation of more sophisticated sampling techniques

## Save and Load Functionality
The project includes functionality to:
- Save trained models for future use
- Load previously trained models for predictions
- Export analysis results and visualizations

## Notes
- The models are optimized for the specific dataset structure
- Regular retraining may be needed as new data becomes available
- Careful consideration of ethical implications when dealing with mental health data
- Feature scaling is crucial for optimal model performance# Clinical-Sentiment-Analysis
